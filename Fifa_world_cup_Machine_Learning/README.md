# Fifa World Cup Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the winner of the FIFA World Cup using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes historical team performance and various features to make predictions.

# Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing information about past FIFA World Cup matches, including team rankings, scores, and tournament details. The dataset is sourced from [source name] and is included in the repository.

# Results
The project applies various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, Linear Discriminant Analysis, LASSO cross-validation, and Ridge cross-validation. It evaluates the performance of each algorithm using mean squared error (MSE) as a measure of prediction accuracy.
