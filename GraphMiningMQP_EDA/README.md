# Mining Graph Patterns from Github Repositories 

## Overview
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools and datasets for analyzing GitHub repositories. It's part of a Graph Mining MQP (Major Qualifying Project) supervised by Professor Murai and Professor Zou. The goal is to uncover insights from GitHub repositories to understand the dynamics and characteristics of software development projects.

## Features
- **TopRepos**: Analysis scripts focused on identifying and analyzing the top GitHub repositories.
- **Data**: Cleaned and organized datasets for EDA.
- **File Structure**: Tools for understanding the organization of repositories.
- **Repo Specific**: Scripts designed for detailed analysis of specific repositories.
- **Repo Status Classification**: Machine learning models for classifying the status of GitHub repositories.


## Next Years Tasks
 * Are there any patterns with any of the 'resurrected" repos? 


## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to Professor Murai and Professor Zou for their guidance and supervision throughout the MQP.
